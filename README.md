A random password generator that uses prompts to ask the user for their password criteria: length, upper case letters, numbers, special characters. The user is guaranteed to get at least one character from each selected category, as well as a lower case letter. 
Reload the page to start the prompts, then press the generate password button to display the random password in the box.
